## How to Expand ü™ê

To expand, you'll just need to create another `.yml` file with the same format, modify what you want, and to make it functional, in the Pagination section, change next/previous page.

### Example
```yaml
Paginated:
  Enabled: true
  Next:
    Page: "next_menu.yml" # It will redirect you to the "next_menu.yml" menu
    Material: ARROW
    Name: "&aNext Page"
    Slot: 50
    Lore:
      - "&7Click to go to the next page"

  Previous:
    Page: "previous_menu.yml" # It will redirect you to the "previous_menu.yml" menu
    Material: ARROW
    Name: "&cPrevious Page"
    Slot: 48
    Lore:
      - "&7Click to go to the previous page"
```
